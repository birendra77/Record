# Android Study Jams 


 ## College Timetable App  (ORARIO)
 

#### Problem Statement



In college, life is hectic and super busy; you have to do a lot of things, such as assignments, tests, club meetings, learning, playing, and so on. Your laptop or mobile app is also flooded with data from all of these different things, and without a good data management and storage method, it becomes extremely messy and difficult to find things. Academics would be the most affected, as you obtain multiple books from various sources and store them in various locations on your computer. It's possible that you'll wind up spending hours on the computer looking for the book or syllabus.

So we used our newly acquired skills in GDSC classes to create an app to solve this problem!!

#### Proposed Solution



So the Solution we have come up with is ORARIO!!
It's an app that has your schedule, all course syllabuses, links to various clubs' instagram/facebook IDs, and Discord accounts, as well as some Fun Time Activities.

#### Functionality & Concepts used 


The app was created in Android Studio with Kotlin as the primary programming language, and some of the features used are listed below:

- Created App Icon & Splash Screen : We created a new icon to replace the app's default icon. We also designed the app slash screen in a simple, beautiful, and modern design and implemented it smoothly.

- Simple Easy Design with Linear Layout: The app was designed in a simple, to-the-point style that is easy to grasp for everyone. For all of its pages, the app uses a linear layout by default, with Scroll View in some areas as needed.

- Interactable Things: There are numerous CardViews throughout the programme, the most of them are clickable. Some of the textViews have been linked to open another link when clicked.

- Navigation & Livedata: In Fun Time, we included navigation to assist users relax after being overwhelmed by the syllabus, so we used navigation fragments to include jokes, games, and YouTube videos to lighten their mood, as well as attempting to integrate livedata into the login process.


#### Application Link & Future Scope

The App is still in its early stages, with only the first version ready with a basic concept, we also have some ideas for how we want to improve our app.

 - To make the Sign In page more complete and to link students' Outlook Email IDs.
 - We'd like to put the app online and have it refresh its schedule with the individuals connected's outlook email addresses when they sign up. In the app, if any classes are cancelled, the app will instantly update.
 - Also, the syllabus will be expanded to cover students in all four years, as well as any adjustments made by SPPU.
 - In the Resource Section, include Previous Year Papers for students.
 - Add a Club Section to show all of the clubs that a student is a member of.
 - Make the app's user interface more appealing, and include a light mode option.

Some Really Really Future Update:

- Help individuals organise meetings; it can get congested if you join too many clubs; hence, this app will send notifications when there are any scheduled meets other than academics, such as those in clubs, and Branch Meetings.


"Orario" is Time(table) in Italian
